#### tidy

* data structure
* workflow
* tool suite

#### data structure

Open an intro to ANY statistics textbook...
.center[
  <img src="assets/figures/intro-stats.png" width="70%">
]
...and you will find that statistics (analysis, plotting - anything, really) starts once you have tidy data.

"It is often said that 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing the data"<sup>1</sup>


"All data are crap, it is just a matter of how much work you have to do to make them useful" _good ol' Ben_

#### data structure: tidy data

* each variable in a column
* each observation in a row
* each value in a cell

#### workflow: write for humans

"Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute." _Hal Abelson_

```r
new_thing <- thing %>%
  do something to thing %>%
  do something to thing %>%
  do something to thing
```
